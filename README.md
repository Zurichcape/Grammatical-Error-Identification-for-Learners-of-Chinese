A system written in Python which uses the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model to identify the errors in texts written by learners of Chinese. After the CRF model has been trained with features such as the character, POS tag the character and dependency labels, the system is able to identify whether a sentence is correct or not, specific error types in the sentence and the exact location of the errors. The data used come from the Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis shared task in the 8th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Gaoqi et al., 2017).
